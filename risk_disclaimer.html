                Cryptographic tokens are inherently high-risk assets, and their value can be highly volatile. By participating, you acknowledge and accept these
                risks and confirm that you have conducted your own research before making any decisions.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Price Volatility</h3>
            <p>

            <h3>2. Wallet Security</h3>
            <p>
                $HPT tokens are stored in cryptographic wallets secured by private keys. Losing access to your wallet or private keys may result in
                permanent loss of your tokens. You are solely responsible for securing access to your wallet and private keys.
            </p>
            <p>HopeToken does not hold copies of private keys and is not liable for wallet-related losses.</p>

            <h3>3. Blockchain and Protocol Risks</h3>
            <p>HopeToken operates on a blockchain-based protocol, which may face risks such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Consensus attacks (e.g., double spending)</li>
                <li>Protocol vulnerabilities due to open-source code</li>
                <li>Hacking and malicious activity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>HopeToken does not control the blockchain network and is not liable for losses resulting from blockchain failures or attacks.</p>

            <h3>4. Legal and Regulatory Uncertainties</h3>
            <p>
                The regulatory framework for cryptographic tokens is evolving globally. Laws may impact the trading, holding, or value of $HPT.
                It is your responsibility to understand and comply with local regulations.
            </p>
            <p>HopeToken is not responsible for legal or regulatory changes affecting your tokens.</p>

            <h3>5. Taxation</h3>
            <p>
                The tax treatment of tokens varies by jurisdiction and may change over time. You are responsible for understanding your tax obligations related
                to purchasing, holding, or trading $HPT.
